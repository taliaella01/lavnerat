    <mark>Potcake Place Is A Puppy Sanctuary On This Tropical Isle Of Dogs </mark> You don&#039;t need to spend a fortune on puppy products and equipment, but you do need the basics, then you can add to those as your pup grows and the average 8 week old puppy will need a potty break approx every 30 minutes to 1 hour during the day, and at least once (probably twice at first).
